**Auto Prompt is a prompt optimization framework designed to enhance and perfect your prompts for real-world use cases.**

The framework automatically generates high-quality, detailed prompts tailored to user intentions. It employs a refinement (calibration) process, where it iteratively builds a dataset of challenging edge cases and optimizes the prompt accordingly. This approach not only reduces manual effort in prompt engineering but also effectively addresses common issues such as prompt [sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009) and inherent prompt [ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04205) issues.


**Our mission:** Empower users to produce high-quality robust prompts using the power of large language models (LLMs).

# Why Auto Prompt?
- **Prompt Engineering Challenges.** The quality of LLMs greatly depends on the prompts used. Even [minor changes](#prompt-sensitivity-example) can significantly affect their performance. 
- **Benchmarking Challenges.**  Creating a benchmark for production-grade prompts is often labour-intensive and time-consuming.
- **Reliable Prompts.** Auto Prompt generates robust high-quality prompts, offering measured accuracy and performance enhancement using minimal data and annotation steps.
- **Modularity and Adaptability.** With modularity at its core, Auto Prompt integrates seamlessly with popular open-source tools such as LangChain, Wandb, and Argilla, and can be adapted for a variety of tasks, including data synthesis and prompt migration.

## System Overview

![System Overview](./docs/AutoPrompt_Diagram.png)

The system is designed for real-world scenarios, such as moderation tasks, which are often  challenged by imbalanced data distributions. The system implements the [Intent-based Prompt Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099) method. The process begins with a user-provided initial prompt and task description, optionally including user examples. The refinement process iteratively generates diverse samples, annotates them via user/LLM, and evaluates prompt performance, after which an LLM suggests an improved prompt.  

The optimization process can be extended to content generation tasks by first devising a ranker prompt and then performing the prompt optimization with this learned ranker. The optimization concludes upon reaching the budget or iteration limit.  


This joint synthetic data generation and prompt optimization approach outperform traditional methods while requiring minimal data and iterations. Learn more in our paper
[Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099) by E. Levi et al. (2024).


**Using GPT-4 Turbo, this optimization typically completes in just a few minutes at a cost of under $1.** To manage costs associated with GPT-4 LLM's token usage, the framework enables users to set a budget limit for optimization, in USD or token count, configured as illustrated [here](docs/examples.md#steps-to-run-example).

## QuickStart
AutoPrompt requires `python <= 3.10`
<br />

> **Step 1** - Download the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Eladlev/AutoPrompt.git
cd AutoPrompt
```

<br />

> **Step 2** - Install dependencies

Use either Conda or pip, depending on your preference. Using Conda:
```bash
conda env create -f environment_dev.yml
conda activate AutoPrompt
```

Using pip: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using pipenv:
```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv sync
```

<br />

> **Step 3** - Configure your LLM. 

Set your OpenAI API key  by updating the configuration file `config/llm_env.yml`
- If you need help locating your API key, visit this [link](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key).

- We recommend using [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) for the LLM. Our framework also supports other providers and open-source models, as discussed [here](docs/installation.md#configure-your-llm).

<br />

> **Step 4** - Configure your Annotator
- Select an annotation approach for your project. We recommend beginning with a human-in-the-loop method, utilizing [Argilla](https://docs.argilla.io/en/latest/index.html). Follow the [Argilla setup instructions](docs/installation.md#configure-human-in-the-loop-annotator-) to configure your server. Alternatively, you can set up an LLM as your annotator by following these [configuration steps](docs/installation.md#configure-llm-annotator-).

- The default predictor LLM, GPT-3.5, for estimating prompt performance, is configured in the `predictor` section of `config/config_default.yml`.

- Define your budget in the input config yaml file using the `max_usage parameter`. For OpenAI models, `max_usage` sets the maximum spend in USD. For other LLMs, it limits the maximum token count.

<br />


> **Step 5** - Run the pipeline

First, configure your labels by editing `config/config_default.yml`
```
dataset:
    label_schema: ["Yes", "No"]
```


For a **classification pipeline**, use the following command from your terminal within the appropriate working directory: 
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```
If the initial prompt and task description are not provided directly as input, you will be guided to provide these details.  Alternatively, specify them as command-line arguments:
```bash
python run_pipeline.py \
    --prompt "Does this movie review contain a spoiler? answer Yes or No" \
    --task_description "Assistant is an expert classifier that will classify a movie review, and let the user know if it contains a spoiler for the reviewed movie or not." \
    --num_steps 30
```
You can track the optimization progress using the [W&B](https://wandb.ai/site) dashboard, with setup instructions available  [here](docs/installation.md#monitoring-weights-and-biases-setup). 


If you are using pipenv, be sure to activate the environment:
``` bash
pipenv shell
python run_pipeline.py  
```
or alternatively prefix your command with `pipenv run`:
```bash
pipenv run python run_pipeline.py 
```

#### Generation pipeline
To run the generation pipeline, use the following example command:
```bash
python run_generation_pipeline.py \
    --prompt "Write a good and comprehensive movie review about a specific movie." \
    --task_description "Assistant is a large language model that is tasked with writing movie reviews."
```
